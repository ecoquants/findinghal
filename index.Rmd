### Calling all divers!

We need your help to **find HAL**, endangered
white abalone in the genus "*Haliotis*" in and around the Southern California Bight (Point Conception to Ensenada).

White abalone (*Haliotis sorenseni*) are on the brink of extinction, **your** observations could contribute to the conservation of this endangered species.

Use our [ID cards](cards.html) to see different abalone species, and help us positively ID white abalone. 

Going diving? Be sure to visit our [Resources](resources.html) page for more SCUBA-related abalone ID and best practices. Want to learn more about these marine snails?
