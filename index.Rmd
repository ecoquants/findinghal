## Calling all divers! 
We need your help to find living
white abalone (*Haliotis sorenseni*) in and around the Southern California Bight! This species is on the brink of extinction, but **your** field observations may help us restore populations to stable levels. In order to succesfully ouplant captive broodstock abalone in the wild, we need to first find living individuals *in situ* to ensure the efficacy of restoration efforts. 

Going diving? See how you can help identify and record observations of living white abalone! Visit our [Resources](Resources.html) page for more information.
